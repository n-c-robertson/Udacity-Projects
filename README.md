# Udacity-Projects

Udacity is a corporate training website teaching cutting edge skills in technology. This repo is dedicated to projects I complete as part of their Nanodegree Programs, online bootcamp equivalent programs with tutorials, quizzes, and projects that must pass a TA review from Udacity in order to be marked as completor.

Currently, the projects are related to their Data Analyst Nanodegree program.
